      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :
      \\\"0\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\"\\n

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-
      **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\"

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :
      \\\"0\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\"\\n

      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are a smart memory
      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :
      \\\"0\\\",\\n                \\\"text\\\" : \\\"User is a software engineer\\\"\\n
      \           }\\n        ]\\n    - Retrieved facts: [\\\"Name is John\\\"]\\n
      \   - New Memory:\\n        {\\n            \\\"memory\\\" : [\\n                {\\n
      \                   \\\"id\\\" : \\\"0\\\",\\n                    \\\"text\\\"

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-
      **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\"

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-
      **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\"

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-
      **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\"

      \   - You should return the updated memory in only JSON format as shown below.
      The memory key should be the same if no changes are made.\\n    - If there is
      an addition, generate a new key and add the new memory corresponding to it.\\n
      \   - If there is a deletion, the memory key-value pair should be removed from

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :

      : \\\"ADD\\\"\\n                }\\n            ]\\n\\n        }\\n\\n2. **Update**:
      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-
      **Example**:\\n    - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\"

      **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the
      information present in the memory, then you have to delete it. Or if the direction
      is to delete the memory, then you have to delete it.\\nPlease note to return
      the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.\\n-

      memory is empty, then you have to add the new retrieved facts to the memory.\\n
      \   - You should return the updated memory in only JSON format as shown below.
      The memory key should be the same if no changes are made.\\n    - If there is
      an addition, generate a new key and add the new memory corresponding to it.\\n
      \   - If there is a deletion, the memory key-value pair should be removed from

      manager which controls the memory of a system.\\nYou can perform four operations:
      (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory,
      and (4) no change.\\n\\nBased on the above four operations, the memory will
      change.\\n\\nCompare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each
      new fact, decide whether to:\\n- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element\\n-
      UPDATE: Update an existing memory element\\n- DELETE: Delete an existing memory
      element\\n- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)\\n\\nThere
      are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:\\n\\n1. **Add**:
      If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then
      you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.\\n- **Example**:\\n
      \   - Old Memory:\\n        [\\n            {\\n                \\\"id\\\" :

      If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory
      but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. \\nIf
      the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements
      present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information.
      \\nExample (a) -- if the memory contains \\\"User likes to play cricket\\\"
      and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves to play cricket with friends\\\", then update
      the memory with the retrieved facts.\\nExample (b) -- if the memory contains
      \\\"Likes cheese pizza\\\" and the retrieved fact is \\\"Loves cheese pizza\\\",
      then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.\\nIf
      the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.\\nPlease
      keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.\\nPlease note to return
